# hand_written_digit-recognition
ANN algorithm to recognize hand-written digit through machine learning

A program that takes picture of image of hand-written digits, and anaylze what the digit mostly would be through machine learning.
This code is written in MatLab, please use an authrorized Matlab to run it.

This project is created during University of Toronto Da Vinci Engineering Enrichment Program [DEEP](http://outreach.engineering.utoronto.ca/pre-university-programs/deep-summer-academy/deep-senior-courses/) in 2016.
I managed to finish this project with help from Instructor [Sinisa Colic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sinisa-colic-18512812?authType=name&authToken=SAvp&trk=contacts-contacts-list-contact_name-0) in one week.
